This is a `create-react-app` portfolio developed with [React](https://reactjs.org/), designed by myself using [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), and deployed on [Heroku](https://heroku.com). The design is a new iteration of the design I created for my [first portfolio](https://github.com/JtheFox/portfolio) built using raw HTML/CSS/JS.
